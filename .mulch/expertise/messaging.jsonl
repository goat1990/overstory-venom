{"type":"decision","title":"Custom SQLite Mail over Beads","rationale":"Mail is high-frequency (agents poll every prompt via hooks). bd CLI at 50-200ms too slow for 10+ agents. SQLite via bun:sqlite gives 1-5ms queries. Beads owns tasks, mail owns communication. Independent failure domains.","classification":"foundational","recorded_at":"2026-02-12T15:18:14.233Z","tags":["sqlite","mail","performance"],"id":"mx-04e745"}
{"type":"convention","content":"Mail client operations that take a message ID should always validate existence before acting. The store layer (L1) is intentionally lenient (SQLite UPDATE on missing row is a no-op), but the client layer (L2) must enforce existence checks and throw MailError with the messageId in context. Validate enum-like CLI inputs (type, priority) at the command layer before casting with 'as', using a const array of valid values and includes() check.","classification":"tactical","recorded_at":"2026-02-12T16:43:56.188Z","id":"mx-7170fd"}
